## Horiseon refactoring project
I undertook this project to take satisfactory code and try and turn it into a more efficient and translatable code for the client. They had a page that worked, but needed some tweaks. There was a broken link, as well as lines and lines of unneccessary code. This project allowed me practice and practical application of taking code to the next level to impress a client. There was also some refactoring to include more accessible HTML code, which allows the webpage to be more accessible across different devices and abilities.
